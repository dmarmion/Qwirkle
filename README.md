# Qwirkle

A command-line implementation of the board game Qwirkle.

Run `make` to compile the game, then `./qwirkle` to play.

This program was created as a group assignment with [Richard](https://github.com/RichardForsey89), [Seiam](https://github.com/AhmadFarighi-s3842662)
and [Aaron](https://github.com/s3840619), then extended upon individually (commits from [`1319dff`](https://github.com/dmarmion/Qwirkle/commit/1319dff9effdd641b0180caa0a63edb103f6ec63) onwards).
